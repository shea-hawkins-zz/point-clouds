// libuv has a built in library for spinning processing into
// a separate task so that the event loop is not blocked
// by heavy operations. Library that implements the NODE vent loop

// V8 engine just comes into play sometimes/

// Internal libraries just use node::ObjectWrap

// Node includes OPENSSL and other deps/
// in the node source tree.

// V* and OpenSSL are exported by node and may be used in
// add-ons
